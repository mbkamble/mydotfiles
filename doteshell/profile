# 'eshell' way of thinking rather than traditional piping several
# commands in a traditional shell.
# Here we use the 'batt' package and use some internal functions to
# generate the results. The code runs faster too.
# mechanics: battery-status-function is a variable to store one of a
# variety of functions to get battery status.
# On Solus platform, this is bound to battery-linux-sysfs, which in
# turn get the data from /sys/class/power_supply/BAT* and formats it
# into an alist of char-based keys. BATTERY-FORMAT is a convenient
# function to access the key values using the format. See
# battery-linux-sysfs for the format specifiers

# An eshell command to unlock the KeepassXC GUI-app

# Lot of learning and experimenting during development, but the
# shortness of code is impressive.
# Reading the safebox.gpg file auto decrypts it into plain text
# (thanks to EPA). parson-parse converts json-structured
# string into hierarchical alist, from which we extract the values of
# password and security file. Finally the dbus API is used to execute
# the method openDatabase on the keepass service
