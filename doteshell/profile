# 'eshell' way of thinking rather than traditional piping several
# commands in a traditional shell.
# Here we use the 'batt' package and use some internal functions to
# generate the results. The code runs faster too.
# mechanics: battery-status-function is a variable to store one of a
# variety of functions to get battery status.
# On Solus platform, this is bound to battery-linux-sysfs, which in
# turn get the data from /sys/class/power_supply/BAT* and formats it
# into an alist of char-based keys. BATTERY-FORMAT is a convenient
# function to access the key values using the format. See
# battery-linux-sysfs for the format specifiers
